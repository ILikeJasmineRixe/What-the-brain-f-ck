# What the (brain) fuck

A (barely-developed) **visual Brainfuck interpreter**.


## What is this?

**What the (brain) fuck** is a WIP Brainfuck interpreter that focuses on **visualizing what the fuck is actually happening**.

Instead of just running Brainfuck code and dumping output, this is meant to:

- Show **every memory cell**
- Show the **pointer moving**
- Show **cells both incrementing and decrementing**
- Make loops visible
- Help people *understand* Brainfuck, not just suffer through it (like me)

Brainfuck is simple.
Understanding what it’s doing is not.
This maybe will fix that.



## What works right now?

This is the first actual README, so as of right now, nothing.



## What *will* this eventually do?

Planned (in no particular order):

- Visual memory manipulation (visible mem cells)
- Pointer animationn (w/ step by step execution)
- Highlighted current instruction
- Input handling
- (Maybe): Pause / step / reset? This seems weird, maybe ill add it idk.
- lots of bugs
